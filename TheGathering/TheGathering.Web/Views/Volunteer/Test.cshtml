                            As protocols are changing daily, we have been working closely with Milwaukee’s Health Department, and the Executive Committee of our board, to implement the best practices. As a result, we will continue to serve Milwaukee’s hungry in the safest way possible through distribution of bag lunches and meals to-go.

                                We will place the distribution table at the door and instead of just one table we will place 2 tables to increase the width of the distance between staff/volunteers and meals guests.
                            </li>
                            <br />

                                Meal guests will no longer be allowed inside the building.

                            <br />

                                Guests will not be allowed to use the restrooms.

                            <li>
                                We will place one bag on the table at a time-after the guest has picked up their bag we will replace it.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                For additional items being distributed staff/volunteer will place the item/s in a bag, set the bag on the table and allow the meal guest to pick it up – no handing anything to anyone.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                Coffee will not be distributed at this time – too many variables with coffee, prep and distribution.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                Gloves and masks will be worn by all staff and volunteers at all times.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                Gloves will be changed more frequently – ie: between tasks and especially if a staff member/volunteer eats anything – to better control the transmission of anything.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                Gatekeeper will monitor the flow of guests outside prior to and throughout the meal distribution process allowing just one person in at a time and ensuring proper social distancing in the line.
