                As protocols are changing daily, we have been working closely with Milwaukee’s Health Department, and the Executive Committee of our board, to implement the best practices. As a result, we will continue to serve Milwaukee’s hungry in the safest way possible through distribution of bag lunches and meals to-go.
                <br />
                <br />
                Safeguards we are implementing beginning Monday, April 13:

                    <li>
                        We will place the distribution table at the door and instead of just one table we will place 2 tables to increase the width of the distance between staff/volunteers and meals guests.
                    </li>
                    <br />

                    <li>
                        We will place one bag on the table at a time-after the guest has picked up their bag we will replace it.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        For additional items being distributed staff/volunteer will place the item/s in a bag, set the bag on the table and allow the meal guest to pick it up – no handing anything to anyone.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Coffee will not be distributed at this time – too many variables with coffee, prep and distribution.

                    <li>
                        Gloves and masks will be worn by all staff and volunteers at all times.

                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Gloves will be changed more frequently – ie: between tasks and especially if a staff member/volunteer eats anything – to better control the transmission of anything.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Gatekeeper will monitor the flow of guests outside prior to and throughout the meal distribution process allowing just one person in at a time and ensuring proper social distancing in the line.
